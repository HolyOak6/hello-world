# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow. I'm such a noob. 
I started coding as a teen in high school, but didn't retain much at all. 
Then I start really learning coding on May 18, 2025. I began with a 100 days of code Bootcamp.
Mostly just during my spare time, whenever I'm not at work or providing for my family.
45 days in and I'm working on the course for day 32.
